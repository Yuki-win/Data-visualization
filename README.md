# Data visualization（Sankey Diagram)
Data visualization involves the use of graphical elements and structures to represent and communicate data patterns, relationships, and insights. A chart is a visual representation that simplifies complex data, making it easier for the viewer to understand and analyze the information. A Sankey chart is a diagram that represents the flow of quantities or values within a system. It uses arrows or lines to represent the flow of these quantities. The width of the arrow or line is proportional to the number being transferred to visualize the relative size within the system. This diagram can also be used to show how an entire quantity or source value is divided into different categories. The aim of this project is to design a tool that can read text files directly and turn them into visual diagrams automatically.
